Me, still excited with my latest tattoo, hence, let me introduce everyone to it!

So, earlier this year I had an idea to get a dragon tattoo, this such a cliché but, hear me out... The year of 2024, is the dragon tattoo in Chinese culture, and me, I was born on the year 2000. Yup, I am a gold dragon, well maybe not chinese, but still a dragon, lol.

After months of searching for the idea, I found this good looking design on Pinterest.

I have always been intrigued by this rectangle tattoo design on the upper arm
and other than that I also don't want my dragon tattoo to look "scary" instead of joyful.

### There are three prominent elements in this tattoo.

- Fuku Riu, the dragon,
- The mountain, and
- the cute little penguin at the bottom.

So let me walk you through these three elements.

## The Fuku Riu Dragon

Fuku Riu is among the most favored dragon of all, widely known for its good luck.

I'd say till this point in my life,
I've been blessed with much luck that helped me to get to this point where I am not.
Not 100% lucky because I believe that to achieve something in life you need effort and fate then, where is luck?
Luck is where effort and fate meet.
I mean, I've been there, you've been there, we all have been there,
no matter how much effort you put into something sometimes things just aren't the way you wanted them to be.

## The Mountain

You might think that the mountain is Mt. Fuji.
Well, it is not wrong, the artist also mentions it too.
But, I like to introduce that as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Yōtei">Mt. Yōtei</a>.

Last February, I visited Japan to attend Taylor Swift concert "The Eras Tour",
and I have the chance to visit two cities in Hokkaido, pref. (Well, actually three if transit city also being counted as one), which is Asahikawa (, Sapporo, ) and Niseko.

Asahikawa is the first city in Japan that I explored (not much but enough to make me fall in love with the town).
The snow just makes it beautiful.

I visited the Asahiyama Zoo which is about 30 minutes bus ride from the train station.
But since me and my girlfriend couldn't speak Japanese and we were in a hurry for the Penguin Walk Show we decided to take a taxi that cost us around 4,000 JPY.
This is the very first time I saw penguins in person. They are just very cute!

Okay, let's back to the mountain.
So, I prefer to "claim" that the mountain is Mt. Yōtei instead of Mt. Fuji to express the beauties of Hokkaido, Pref.
especially the city, Asahikawa.

## The Penguin (ペンギン)

By now, I think it is pretty safe to assume that whoever reading this out there knows that I LOVE penguins!

Other than their overload cuteness, penguins are highly social animals that form strong family and community bonds.
Penguins are family-oriented creatures, just like me where family means the most.
Although I grew up in a family that was far from harmony
for me it is still the place I'll come back to comfort my soul.

This is far from any other things that I've posted on this blog but,
I just want to share a bit about my hobby other than writing a bunch of codes.

For those who ask,
I got this tattooed by [q.ink.y](https://www.instagram.com/q.ink.y) at [Revolver Tattoo Studio](https://www.instagram.com/revolver_id).
They have many great-talented artists that won't make you disappointed.
