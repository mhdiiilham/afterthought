# Hello World
It started when I bought a bottle of Pandan Syrup (and it pumper, of course, cause, lol I'm a half-time barista now). My girl recommended I try this Pandan Latte from Fore Coffee, so I tried it, and I love it. And I don't know how, but when we were on our way back home I have this impulsive thought, "let's go buy Pandan Syrup and make our own Pandan Latte". This paragraph is out of topic, but that's how it starts. I love brewing my own coffee now (Okay, only V60 and Japanese Cold Brew).

A couple of days ago, I think on Wednesday, I bought a scale, thermometer, and a manual coffee grinder. Why? Uhm, I don't know exactly, but we have Starbucks Single Origin whole beans. When the package arrived I get so excited to try brewing my own. With the right coffee-water ratio, I'm expecting my own-made manual brew should taste way better than the average coffee shop (okay it's just my perfectionist).

# Brewing Time
Before we started with the technique, I assume you already had those coffee tools, if you don't have them yet then why bother reading this post (or at least buy one and then come back here)?

I'm going to embed the references video here so you can learn it yourself.

I have read so many coffee brewing techniques, but I think this one suits me the most.

## Specifications
> Brew Ratio: 60gr of coffee per a litre of water<br/></br>
> Grind Size: medium to fine<br/></br>
> Water Temperature: He suggested "as hot as possible", but my preference still between 92 - 96 Celcius</br></br>

## Brewing Steps

In this post, I'm going to make 250ml of coffee.

### 1. Rinse
Before we start brewing, it's good to rinse our paper filter first. This removes any paper taste and preheats the brewer.

### 2. Add Coffee
Add coffee grounds to the V60 filter and create a small well in the middle of the grounds. This helps to evenly saturate all the grounds during the blooming phase.

### 3. Start the timer, blooming phase
Start your timer and begin pouring water 2x the weight of your coffee. I use 15 gr of coffee grounds then I'm gonna need to pour 30 gr of water. From the videos, the suggestion is you don't want the blooming water is more than 3x of coffee weight. Why? I don't know, go watch the video.

And also, Swirl the coffee slurry until evenly mixed. The aim is to wet all the coffee grounds by evenly mixing bloom water and coffee.

Blooms up to 45s before pouring more water. This allows CO2 to escape which will improve extraction.

### 4. After blooming phase
At 45 seconds, add water aiming for 60% of your total brew weight.

<b>This phase is critical!</b>

Since you already added 30gr bloom water, add 120g in 30s. A full V60 is good to maintain high temperatures

### 5. Last Pour
Add more water aiming for 100% of the total brewing weight (mine is 120gr more water), poor a little slower than in the first phase, not too aggressively, then stir 1x clockwise and 1x anti-clockwise.

Okay, that's it. Happy `try-and-error`!
